Autogenerate everything: (Needs better cacheing for performance)
	Percent and Timeframe	-> Hitrate: 0.1 0.25 0.5
	Number of Indicators	-> 1 2 4 8
	Signal Machine			-> Avg, Threshold 0.5, " 0.7, Aggressive, Defensive
	Order Machine			-> TP SL Hedge Invert Signal
	Volume Optimizers		-> Time, Tags, Streak

(Test different: wights / Timeframes / Markets / Percentages / Train periods / Signal machines / Order Machines)

Debug the indicators

Visualize

Implement good Backtesting statistics and visualization

Create live papertrade api / framework
Create demo account trading api

Possible bugs:
	Last index of learningIndicator sampling not used

Alternatives:
	Create Signalmachine with machine learning
	Implement more tests to find bugs
	Make the Indicator Generation process smart, maybe genetic
