# Forex Dataminer

A tool to analyze timeseries data to find patterns for algorithmic trading. If you have any questions about my approach contact me: moritz.goeckel (AT) gmail.com 

This is a humongous project entirely in C#. It is all about numbers crunching and more or less no user interface. Because of the size of the project Im using all my OOP experience to keep in manageable. There is a lot of unit testing going on. Usually I include cool screenshots here, but as I said: No user interface, just numbers.
